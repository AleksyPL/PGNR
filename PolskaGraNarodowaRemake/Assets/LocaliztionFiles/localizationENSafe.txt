Motherland Calls, Pilot!
//Plot - Plot
You have to fly a new Polish plane far to the East. <br><br>But don't count on it being an easy task. Avoid obstacles on your way and destroy them with garbage found on board. <br><br>But remember: the plane's equipment is set to accommodate the greater weight of the plane, the more garbage you throw out, the more difficult it will be to fly. <br><br>Show everyone what a good pilot you are.
