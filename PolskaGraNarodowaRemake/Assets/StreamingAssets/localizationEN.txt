//How to play - Story
You have to fly the new Polish National Dreamliner far to the East with the President on board.\nBut don't think that THE EAST will let you land so easily! Avoid the fog, cut down the birches, destroy the TNT.\nVodka is your weapon. Unlimited quantities, because it is a Polish plane.\nBut remember: the more you drink, the harder it is to fly ...\nBefore throwing the vodka away, drink a bit. The lighter bottle goes much farther.\nShow the President that a Pole can!
